Alientation is a card drafting, set collecting game, about making the ideal real estate setup for your alien clients.

## Set up

1. Shuffle all the Creature Cards
2. Give each player their pieces:
  1. 1 Sun card
  2. 2 cubes
  3. 1 scoring card
  4. 9 Creature Cards
3. To set up their play areas, players...
  1. place their sun cards in front of them
  2. place their score cards to one side of them
  3. place a cube on the 0 space of the sun track
  4. place a cube on the 0/30 space of their score card

## Gameplay

### Aim

The game is played over 3 rounds, at the end of the game the player with the highest score wins.

### Round

For the first round, the friendliest player is the start player. In future rounds the first player to fill their system in the previous turn is the start player.

#### Draft

Simulataneously, each player **must**...

1. Choose a card to keep face down on the table
2. Pass the remaining cards to the player on their left
3. Repeat until all players have 9 cards on the table

#### Play

In player order, the active player must **either**...

1. Play 1 card in their own system, or...
2. play 1 card in another player's system

- Cards must be played orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to the player's Sun card
- The first player to complete their system takes the Firsties card to denote they are the new start player
- Players with complete systems may only play cards to other players' systems
- The final card in each player's hand is always discarded

#### Cleanup

1. Each player scores their system, tracking their score on their score card
2. Each player updates their Sunnies total on their sun card

Then, if this wasn't the 3rd round...

1. Players discard all creature cards from their systems
2. Shuffle all cards (discard and draw decks) before beginning the next round
3. If playing with more than two players, alternate drafting direction

## Game end

The game ends after 3 rounds. The player with the most points wins.

## Easily forgot or misunderstood rules

- Keep track of Sunnies between rounds
- Your score accumulates between rounds
- Switch card drafting direction between rounds
- The last card in a player's hand is always discarded
- All cards are shuffled together to form a new draw deck each round
