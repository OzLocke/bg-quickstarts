- Seal/Unseal any in-play Wonder Card (rotate a Wonder Card on it's side to Seal it, or rotate it back if already Sealed to Unseal it. Sealed Wonder Cards cannot be used)
- Replace a card in the Asset Row with the top card of the Asset Deck, placing the original card at the bottom of the Asset Deck, for 2 Knowledge Points
- Move the Volfyirion token either from Volfyirion's Lair to an enemy City Card, or from one of your City Cards to Volfyirion's Lair, for 8 Knowledge Points

#### Activate

- Activate abilities of in-play cards
- Secondary abilities may be activated if the required conditions are met (e.g. if a particular Minor House card is in play, or if you choose to remove a card from the game)

### End phase

  - Remove any Troop or Building Cards from the game
  - Flip the City Card to it's Destroyed side
- Refill any empty Asset Row or Wonder Card slots from their respective decks

## Game end

The game ends when all cities of one player are destroyed. The player with cities remaining is the winner.

## Easily forgot or misunderstood rules

### First turn

- On their first turn of the game, each player may shuffle their staring hand back into their draw deck and draw 5 new cards
- On their first turn, the first player may discard a single card from the Asset Row to the bottom of the Asset Deck, then refill the Asset Row with the top card of the Asset Deck
- On their first turn, the second player may discard all cards in the Asset Row and to the bottom of the Asset Deck, then refill the Asset Row from the top of the Asset Deck

### Hand management

- If there are not enough cards in your House Deck when drawing, draw as many as there are, shuffle your Discard Pile and place it face down to form a new House Deck, and then draw the rest
- If there are no more cards in your House Deck and no cards in your Discard Pile, continue with the cards in hand

### Game

- When playing cards to a City Card slot, if there was already a card in the slot you played the card to, the previous card is removed from the game
- You may take any actions in any order, and multiple times (although individual cards abilities and points can only be trigged once each)
- When acquiring cards, **do not** fill back the empty space, this happens at the end of the round
- When acquiring a Wonder Card, you may choose to remove a card in your hand, discard pile, or your in-play area (don't forget to gain any points from it first) from the game
- Once Volfyirion is defeated, no more Wonder Cards can be claimed this game
- Each card's abilities can be activated once per turn, but both a cards main and its secondary ability may be activated

### Miscellaneous

- The top card of the Asset Deck should always be face up, but does not count as an available card for the purpose of acquiring cards
