## Overview

Players take it in turns to place squares on their boards in the form of (polyomino) Rune Tiles that they discard from their hands. They then use the shapes they have created with these squares to complete buildings from a central pool. Buildings offer bonuses in game, and points at the end of the game in the form of stars. Building cards also include *hourglass icons* that dictate the end of the game. Once the game is over, the player with the most stars wins.

## Set up

### General set up

1. Sort the building cards by level (number on back), shuffle them in their respecticve decks, and place them as a column in the center of the table as three decks
2. For each level of building card, draw and lay out four building cards in a row next to the deck
3. Shuffle and place the Rune Tiles (polyominoes) around the cards forming a circle, then place the queen between two randomly selected Rune Tiles
4. Sort the Rune Pieces (squares) by colour and place them in a pile in reach of all players
5. Create a supply of Elemental Spirits (disks) according to the following table:

| Players | Disks per type |
|:---------:|:--------------:|
|1        |2               |
|2        |4               |
|3        |5               |
|4        |All             |

### Player set up
