<h2 id="set-up">Set up</h2>

<li>Give each player their pieces:

<ol>
<li>1 Sun card</li>
<li>2 cubes</li>
<li>1 scoring card</li>
<li>9 Creature Cards</li>
</ol></li>
<li>To set up their play areas, players&hellip;

</ol>

<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>

<h3 id="aim">Aim</h3>

<p>The game is played over 3 rounds, at the end of the game the player with the highest score wins.</p>

<h3 id="round">Round</h3>

<p>For the first round, the friendliest player is the start player. In future rounds the first player to fill their system in the previous turn is the start player.</p>

<h4 id="draft">Draft</h4>

<p>Simulataneously, each player <strong>must</strong>&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose a card to keep face down on the table</li>
<li>Pass the remaining cards to the player on their left</li>
<li>Repeat until all players have 9 cards on the table</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="play">Play</h4>

<p>In player order, the active player must <strong>either</strong>&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>Play 1 card in their own system, or&hellip;</li>
<li>play 1 card in another player&rsquo;s system</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Cards must be played orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to the player&rsquo;s Sun card</li>
<li>The first player to complete their system takes the Firsties card to denote they are the new start player</li>
<li>Players with complete systems may only play cards to other players&rsquo; systems</li>
<li>The final card in each player&rsquo;s hand is always discarded</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cleanup">Cleanup</h4>

<ol>
<li>Each player scores their system, tracking their score on their score card</li>
<li>Each player updates their Sunnies total on their sun card</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, if this wasn&rsquo;t the 3rd round&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>Players discard all creature cards from their systems</li>
<li>Shuffle all cards (discard and draw decks) before beginning the next round</li>
<li>If playing with more than two players, alternate drafting direction</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="game-end">Game end</h2>

<p>The game ends after 3 rounds. The player with the most points wins.</p>

<h2 id="easily-forgot-or-misunderstood-rules">Easily forgot or misunderstood rules</h2>

<ul>
<li>Keep track of Sunnies between rounds</li>
<li>Your score accumulates between rounds</li>
<li>Switch card drafting direction between rounds</li>
<li>The last card in a player&rsquo;s hand is always discarded</li>
<li>All cards are shuffled together to form a new draw deck each round</li>
</ul>
