Optionally you may continue to decide full player ranking.\nAdditionally, if any player runs out of components and does not have more by the beginning of their next turn (see Other rules) they are immediately out of the game\nOther rules If you knock down pieces belonging to another player, you must give them an equal amount of each piece knocked down from your own supply. They will then set up their pieces again. This does not apply to your own pieces.\n"
