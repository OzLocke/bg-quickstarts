<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>

<h3 id="aim">Aim</h3>

<p>The aim of the game is to get rid of all of your cars, the first player to do so wins.</p>

<h3 id="turn">Turn</h3>

<p>On a player&rsquo;s turn, they take the following actions in order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build a column (optional: with a junction)</li>
<li>Build a road</li>
<li>Place cars (if able)</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="columns-and-junctions">Columns and Junctions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Place a column or junction within a road&rsquo;s distance of the end of your current road (or roads if you already have a junction)</li>
<li>Normal columns must be one disk taller or shorter than the column you are linking from when placing a new column</li>
<li>Columns with junctions on top may be any height, but must have at least one gray column disk underneath them</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="roads">Roads</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>General</strong>

<ul>
<li>Your road <strong>must</strong> lead from the end of your current road (or roads if you have a junction) to the column you just built</li>
<li>Your road may <strong>not</strong> stick out from the columns it is placed on (the end of the road must be fully over the columns)</li>
<li>Your road <strong>may</strong> overlap or be next to any road already on the column</li>
<li>You may <strong>not</strong> place roads in a way that forms a loop of roads</li>
<li>Your road may <strong>not</strong> touch other roads (except where they touch the column)</li>
<li>Your road may <strong>not</strong> overlap columns (yours or others)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Junctions</strong>

<ul>
<li>You <strong>may</strong> build two roads leading from one of your junctions</li>
<li>You can start second roads from junctions at any time</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exits</strong>

<ul>
<li>You may build a road from a column of 1 disk in height so that it&rsquo;s end touches the table, this is an exit</li>
<li>You cannot continue to build from an exit</li>
<li>You can have multiple exits if you have used a junction</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cars">Cars</h4>

<ul>
<li>Place one car anywhere on your newly created road (except over the start or end column) for each road that your new road directly passes over or under</li>
<li>You can only place cars for passing over or under your opponents&rsquo; roads, not your own</li>
<li>You may place a bonus car on any of your roads that form an exit (you can still place normal cars on exit roads)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="game-end">Game end</h2>

<p>The game ends when one player places all of their cars. Optionally you may continue to decide full player ranking.</p>

<p>Additionally, if any player runs out of components and does not have more by the beginning of their next turn (see Other rules) they are immediately out of the game</p>

<h2 id="other-rules">Other rules</h2>

<p>If you knock down pieces belonging to another player, you must give them an equal amount of each piece knocked down from your own supply. They will then set up their pieces again. This does not apply to your own pieces.</p>
